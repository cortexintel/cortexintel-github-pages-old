title: 'DC Ruby Talk: Environment Parity'
---

Before the July 4th holiday, I gave a
[talk](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/events/125375432/) at [DC
RUG](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/) about how to set up development and
production environments. The talk discussed setting up multiple environments,
how to minimize configuration differences between environments, and some great
tools for use in development and deployment.  

Here are the [slides on
Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/geoffharcourt/dcrug-achieving-developmentproduction-parity).
